  <p>So I do teaching in all forms over here at Guerilla Showrunner. There&rsquo;s the blog posts, of course, and there&rsquo;ll shortly be video courses and ebooks and all kinds of cool things.</p>

<p>But first, I wanted to give you guys something cool, and free.</p>

<p>See, I know what most of us guerilla showrunners are looking for - we want more fans.</p>

<p>Hardcore fans.</p>

<p>Raving fans.</p>

<p>Keep-a-shrine-to-your-show, write-letters-to-the-characters, obsessively-purchase-everything-related-to-it, stalk-the-creator-with-a-box-of-chocolates-and-their-used-underwear fans.</p>

<p>Well, maybe not the last one.</p>

<p>But we want srs fans. Srs fans who will talk about our shows, comment on our shows, and yes, buy stuff from our shows.</p>

<p>So I thought that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d make our first course about. And to make it special, to give you a chance to see what we&rsquo;ve got, and to get the Guerilla Showrunner boat rolling, Iit&rsquo;s totally free.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll learn:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>3 things you can do in the next hour to make more of** your casual viewers come back** and get involved in your show.</p></li>

<li><p>Why your <strong>RSS feed and YouTube subscribers</strong> aren&rsquo;t attracting as many viewers as you&rsquo;d like - and how to fix that.</p></li>

<li><p>How to design a show or an episode to** fascinate your viewers **- so that whenever they think about your show, they&rsquo;ll feel good.</p></li>

<li><p>Why you <strong>don&rsquo;t need everyone to like your show</strong> - and how pissing some people off will help turn you into a superstar.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Sign up below!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get Crazed Stalkers&rdquo; will pop into your email inbox as a series of high-information, five to ten minute videos on how you can turn those casual, semi-interested viewers into hardcore, raving, cult-like fans.</p>
