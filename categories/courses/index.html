  <p>So, it&rsquo;s new project season here at Guerilla Showrunner Towers, and as you may have seen on Twitter, I&rsquo;m considering working on a more detailed manual for show promotion than I could offer in a blog post.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve made the mistake of developing something big without checking it&rsquo;s needed before, and it just wastes everyone&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>So - would you be interested in buying a complete guide to promoting your online film or series? It&rsquo;d basically cover the same strategies that I used to get <a href="http://www.bloodspell.com">BloodSpell</a> 100k+ viewers and exposure on CNN and a whole bunch of other places, <a href="http://www.kamikazecookery.com">Kamikaze Cookery</a> featured all over the &lsquo;net, and so on, plus a whole bunch of new stuff I&rsquo;ve learned in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>Topics I&rsquo;m currently thinking to cover would include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to network outside the web series community to get your show wider exposure</p></li>

<li><p>How to make sure from Day 1 that your show has a large audience who will watch it.</p></li>

<li><p>How to use sites like Reddit, Digg, and Stumbleupon to drive the viewers you want to your film or show</p></li>

<li><p>Offline press - how to approach them, how to win them over.</p></li>

<li><p>How to use search engine optimisation and article marketing with your videos to create steady traffic streams.</p></li>

<li><p>Advertising - what works, what doesn&rsquo;t, and where to get it at affordable rates</p></li>

<li><p>How to cut trailers, and how to use them</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So - sound interesting enough to spend a bit of cash on? And if so, what topics would you be particularly interested in seeing covered?</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s a happy day. I&rsquo;ve completed the first course from Guerilla Showrunner - Get Crazed Stalkers!</p>

<p>And to add on to all that - it&rsquo;s a free course. Completely, totally, utterly and forever.</p>

<p>This one&rsquo;s about your fans. Specifically, it&rsquo;s about the dedicated, hardcore fans (the &ldquo;stalkers&rdquo; - don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m not actually trying to get you stalked) that every show thrives on, and how to convert your Anonymous YouTube Visitors into people whose first name, kids&rsquo; interests, and credit card numbers you know.</p>

<p>The course is in three parts of ten minutes&rsquo; video each (it was going to be five minutes, but it turns out I had rather more stuff to say than I thought I did), in which you&rsquo;ll learn:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>3 things you can do in the next hour to make more of** your casual viewers come back** and get involved in your show.</p></li>

<li><p>Why your <strong>RSS feed and YouTube subscribers</strong> aren’t attracting as many viewers as you’d like – and how to fix that.</p></li>

<li><p>How to design a show or an episode to** fascinate your viewers **- so that whenever they think about your show, they’ll feel good.</p></li>

<li><p>Why you <strong>don’t need everyone to like your show</strong> – and how pissing some people off will help turn you into a superstar.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To get on the list and recieve the first video, <a href="http://guerillashowrunner.com/crazed-stalkers-free/">subscribe to Get Crazed Stalkers.</a></p>

<p>The link to the first video will drop through your inbox door, if such a thing exists, a few minutes afterward.</p>

<p>I really hope you guys find this course useful. It&rsquo;s turned into rather a larger project than I had planned - maybe I should have turned it into a paid-for thing instead. Ach, well!</p>

<p>If you know anyone who&rsquo;d find a course about getting more and more dedicated fans for their Internet show or whatever else it is they do that gets fans, please do let them know about the course. I really want to help as many people with this stuff as I can.</p>
