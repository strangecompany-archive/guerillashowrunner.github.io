  <p>I&rsquo;ve got a post coming either today or tomorrow entitled &ldquo;The Five Stages Of Editing - Denial, Anger, Bargaining, etc&hellip;&rdquo; - look out for it!</p>

<p>However, after that (and after the Money post), I&rsquo;ve got a selection of titles I&rsquo;m considering. And I&rsquo;d really like your input on which one you want to see!</p>

<p>Options include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Four Hour Web Series</strong> - if you only had four hours a week to make a web series, how would you do it, and more importantly, what wouldn&rsquo;t you do?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>How to use Google Analytics for your show</strong> - what to look for, what features you don&rsquo;t know exist, how to track external site hits, that sort of thing.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Either You Exposit, or I Electrocute You With This Table Lamp</strong> - a look at exposition and how to use it, with examples from &ldquo;24&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Lessons from Porn sites</strong> - there is a genre of web show that makes quite a lot of money, thank you, and it&rsquo;s porn. What can we learn from the best porn sites for our own shows?</p></li>

<li><p><strong>More Stuff On Money</strong> - talking more about the ways to extract money from web shows, and how to make a living at them. Likely to be somewhat speculative, because no-one&rsquo;s really figured this out yet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Any of them jump out at you? Or would you like to see something else entirely?</p>

<p>Oh, in other news, we&rsquo;re getting some great feedback from <a href="http://guerillashowrunner.com/crazed-stalkers-free/">Get Crazed Stalkers</a>, which I&rsquo;ll be posting on the course page soon (when I have a minute). Thanks, guys, it&rsquo;s great to hear everyone&rsquo;s getting so much from it!</p>
