  <p>Hey, guys!</p>

<p>So, unfortunately, the time has come when I have to concentrate hard on making shows, and less on writing about them. As such, things are going to go kinda quiet around here for a bit.</p>

<p>I may sometimes do a drive-by article, but they&rsquo;ll be irregular. Best way would be to subscribe to my Twitter or the RSS feed here to get notified when they appear.</p>

<p>On the publicity product I was talking about a while ago - that may or may not happen. I&rsquo;m not seeing a huge amount of demand for it, and it&rsquo;d take a lot of time. If you&rsquo;re really, really waiting for it, do comment or contact me, since that will affect whether or not it appears!</p>

<p>Anyway, see you on the flipside, with a cool new series.</p>
