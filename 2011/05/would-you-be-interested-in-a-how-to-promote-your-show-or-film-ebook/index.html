  <p>So, it&rsquo;s new project season here at Guerilla Showrunner Towers, and as you may have seen on Twitter, I&rsquo;m considering working on a more detailed manual for show promotion than I could offer in a blog post.</p>

<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve made the mistake of developing something big without checking it&rsquo;s needed before, and it just wastes everyone&rsquo;s time.</p>

<p>So - would you be interested in buying a complete guide to promoting your online film or series? It&rsquo;d basically cover the same strategies that I used to get <a href="http://www.bloodspell.com">BloodSpell</a> 100k+ viewers and exposure on CNN and a whole bunch of other places, <a href="http://www.kamikazecookery.com">Kamikaze Cookery</a> featured all over the &lsquo;net, and so on, plus a whole bunch of new stuff I&rsquo;ve learned in the last couple of years.</p>

<p>Topics I&rsquo;m currently thinking to cover would include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to network outside the web series community to get your show wider exposure</p></li>

<li><p>How to make sure from Day 1 that your show has a large audience who will watch it.</p></li>

<li><p>How to use sites like Reddit, Digg, and Stumbleupon to drive the viewers you want to your film or show</p></li>

<li><p>Offline press - how to approach them, how to win them over.</p></li>

<li><p>How to use search engine optimisation and article marketing with your videos to create steady traffic streams.</p></li>

<li><p>Advertising - what works, what doesn&rsquo;t, and where to get it at affordable rates</p></li>

<li><p>How to cut trailers, and how to use them</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So - sound interesting enough to spend a bit of cash on? And if so, what topics would you be particularly interested in seeing covered?</p>
