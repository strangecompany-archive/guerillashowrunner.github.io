  <p>Oh, ye gods. What a horror.</p>

<p>I watched an episode of &ldquo;The Apprentice&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know - &ldquo;The Apprentice&rdquo; is a UK reality TV show where a bunch of alleged experienced businessmen and women compete in a variety of allegedly business-related tasks to become the &ldquo;apprentice&rdquo; to alleged business guru (and, to be fair, successful tycoon) Alan Sugar.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s horrifying. &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; business practise is presented as a mass of sniping, backbiting, and bullying from Lord Sugar on down. The tasks bear about as much relation to actual business as that dude in the bear suit at your local mall does to an actual grizzly.</p>

<p>And the contenders are both spectacularly odious - sexist, overbearing, pretentious, backstabbing - and incredibly stupid. Stupid to the point that a team of seven of them, in an entire day, couldn&rsquo;t figure out what a &ldquo;cloche&rdquo; was in the context of a posh hotel. (To be fair, they weren&rsquo;t allowed to use Google, which would have put my personal time on that task up from 30 seconds to, ooh, about 3 minutes).</p>

<p>And yet these guys and girls are all very successful in business. One had made 70k a year whilst studying at the same time. Another ran a not-that-small company.</p>

<p>And this got me thinking. If you forced one of these morons to run a web series, would they do as well at that, in spite of their deficiencies?</p>

<p>Quite likely. Why?</p>

<p>Balls.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re smart, sensitive and empathic, as most web series creators are, it&rsquo;s very easy to assess the risks. Very easy to get into other peoples&rsquo; shoes and figure out what they might think of our little web series. And so we&rsquo;re &ldquo;realistic&rdquo;, and focus our efforts on stuff we have assessed we&rsquo;ve got a good chance of succeeding at, and avoid things that are doomed to horrible failure or serious embarassment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, if you&rsquo;re dumb as a post and cocky as something that can&rsquo;t be mentioned on primetime TV, your first reaction to &ldquo;How do I publicise this series?&rdquo; is &ldquo;Call the New York Times and tell them it&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And actually, that&rsquo;s a very, very good idea.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working very hard in the last few years on differentiating between situations where I&rsquo;ve got no chance at all, and situations where I&rsquo;ve got a pretty small chance, but a good chance of feeling embarassed too. The latter are very, very easy to mistake for the former, because it gets you out of scary stuff.</p>

<p>Scary stuff like seriously pitching the New York Times film section about your web series - not sending a generic PR, but actually calling them up and saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this thing and it&rsquo;s AWESOME!&rdquo;. Like taking your dream cast list and actually calling their agents. Like phoning a major theater chain and saying &ldquo;Hey, guys, fancy showing the pilot of my series as a trailer to Pirates of the Carribean 4?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, you&rsquo;re probably sitting there thinking &ldquo;yeah, but there&rsquo;s no chance that would ever work.&rdquo; Wrong. There is SOME chance that would work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been featured in the New York Times. And on CNN. Entertainment Weekly. About half of the UK&rsquo;s national newspapers. And various other places. It&rsquo;s doable. Hell, I pitched one of the biggest name casting agents in the UK the idea for a World of Warcraft fanfilm and she agreed to work on it. And subsequently a whole bunch of very famous people also agreed to be in it, thanks to her. (Joanna Lumley. Brian Blessed. Jack Davenport. Anna Chancellor. Think they&rsquo;d agree to be in a tiny webseries? Turns out, yes they would.)</p>

<p>Does this mean that I&rsquo;m awesome? Not especially. It just means I made a bunch of phonecalls that I thought had almost no chance for success, and it turned out my risk assessment wasn&rsquo;t as good as I thought it was.</p>

<p>What stuff could you do for your web series (or hey, I know we have non-webseries readers, your film, or your iPhone app, or your ebook) that would totally revolutionise its success? Which ones are clearly stupidly impossible?</p>

<p>How confident are you that they&rsquo;re impossible?</p>

<p>Confident enough that you&rsquo;ll take 10 minutes of embarassing telephone conversation over the chance for an A-Lister as your lead actor?</p>

<p>Confident enough it can&rsquo;t happen that it&rsquo;s not even worth TRYING to get the Hollywood Reporter to cover you?</p>

<p>Are you really so sure that you&rsquo;re right?</p>

<p>Or can you pretend to be dumb enough that you believe it might work?</p>

<p>Smart&rsquo;s good. But sometimes, to achieve remarkable stuff, you&rsquo;ve got to pretend you&rsquo;ve got balls of steel but a brain of lead.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>P.S. Oh, and don&rsquo;t just do it once. Hollywood Reporter told you to shove it? Engage dumb-but-cocky mode again. They&rsquo;re clearly morons who don&rsquo;t appreciate your genius. Time to phone Variety.</p>

  <p>It&rsquo;s easy to get tunnel vision on the Web. You make Web series, you read the forums for your chosen form of video (live action, Machinima, whatever), you read Web Series Network, you check the Twitters for #webserieschat&hellip;</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p>No kidding, there&rsquo;s a hell of a lot of useful information on the indiefilm/webseries/etc blogospheres. But particularly for a new medium like the web series, a lot of the most valuable info I&rsquo;ve found over the past 13 or so years has come from sites in other fields - whether they&rsquo;re internet marketing, aimed at people running pro blogs or making webapps, there are a lot of people out there trying to solve some of the same problems that hit us.</p>

<p>Here are four completely non-visual-media blogs that I would recommend you pretty much consume from start to end - and I guarantee you&rsquo;ll come out with a whole bunch of new perspectives.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="tim-ferriss-blog">Tim Ferriss&rsquo; Blog</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the Four Hour Work Week (if you haven&rsquo;t picked a copy up, you should), and author Tim Ferriss&rsquo;s blog is more of the same - supremely well-thought-out, unconventional writing on how to achieve unbelievable stuff using unusual methods.</p>

<p>Only some of the blog is relevant to web series (although it&rsquo;s all interesting), but when it is, it&rsquo;s absolute gold dust.</p>

<p>Start off with <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2011/03/10/12-lessons-learned-while-marketing-the-4-hour-body/">12 lessons from marketing &ldquo;The Four Hour Body&rdquo;&rdquo;</a> (Tim&rsquo;s new book) - this is hardcore information on how Mr Ferriss pushed his latest book straight into the NYT bestsellers list on a pretty small budget, including bits on getting hordes of positive reviews, how to use a blog to launch a product without pissing readers off, negotiation, and more.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re up for something seriously in-depth after that, his <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/12/13/how-to-create-a-global-phenomenon-for-less-than-10000/">lengthy talk</a> about how he pushed his first book, &ldquo;The Four Hour Work Week&rdquo; is just brilliant, although you&rsquo;ll need an hour or so to digest it.</p>

<p>His <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2010/09/28/tucker-max/">profile on Tucker Max</a>, the bestselling self-published author/raconteur, is another really interesting read, including a whole bunch of tips from Tucker Max on how he managed to get so successful. Lots of very hard-edged, sensible advice on pushing low-budget, self-published work - exactly the sort of stuff we need as web series creators. (I particularly like his tips on &ldquo;free&rdquo; - what to keep free, when and how.)</p>

<p>Finally, Tim&rsquo;s tips on <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2011/01/25/from-first-tv-to-dr-oz-how-to-get-local-media-and-national-media/">how to get into national media</a> are very unconventional - forget all the &ldquo;just have a great story&rdquo; stuff that gets peddled a lot - and really interesting. I haven&rsquo;t tried them (yet - will be doing soon) but they work for him, they sound very plausible, and they&rsquo;re a good long way from the norm.</p>

<p>You can find Tim&rsquo;s blog at <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog">http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog</a> - all his blogging categories are accessible from the right-hand-side menu. I&rsquo;d recommend checking out &ldquo;Marketing&rdquo; to start with.</p>

<h2 id="ittybiz">Ittybiz</h2>

<p>Naomi Dunford&rsquo;s the sweary, slightly disorganised, terrifyingly honest marketing guru for thousands of small business owners, many of whom are or were scared stiff of the whole &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; thing. Her blog&rsquo;s on hiatus right now, but it&rsquo;s pretty much worth reading through from the start for great tips on everything from productivity to sex shop-inspired marketing tips. No, really.</p>

<p>Talking of which, one of the most relevant Ittybiz posts is entitled &ldquo;<a href="http://ittybiz.com/how-to-sell-a-sex-chair/">How to sell a sex chair</a>&rdquo;. Naomi looks at all the aspects of a particularly well-designed website selling extremely expensive sex furniture, and uses it to give general lessons about marketing stuff which doesn&rsquo;t have hard-edged benefits - very useful for web series creators.</p>

<p>If I was only allowed to recommend one IttyBiz post, though, it&rsquo;d be &ldquo;<a href="http://ittybiz.com/when-you-feel-like-a-raging-failure/">When You Feel Like A Raging Failure</a>&rdquo;. Great, honest writing from someone who is more successful than most of us can hope to be - but still feels like a failure sometimes. If you haven&rsquo;t had a day like that with your webseries yet, I&rsquo;m sorry to say that you will, eventually. When you do, read this post.</p>

<p>Finally, &ldquo;<a href="http://ittybiz.com/time-management-how-to-pull-an-all-nighter/">How To Pull An All-Nighter</a>&rdquo; is fantastic practical advice for something that pretty much all of us webseries guys and girls are going to end up doing at some point.</p>

<p>The complete IttyBiz archive is here: <a href="http://ittybiz.com/archive/">http://ittybiz.com/archive/</a>. I&rsquo;d recommend hitting &ldquo;expand all&rdquo; and just start browsing.</p>

<h2 id="andrew-chen">Andrew Chen</h2>

<p>Andrew Chen&rsquo;s a hardcore geek webapp biz guy. His posts tend to be very, very detailed, numbers-oriented, with graphs and a lot of jargon - but they&rsquo;re extremely deep and contain some fantastic original thinking that&rsquo;ll change the way you think about your marketing.</p>

<p>Start off with the classic, &ldquo;<a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2007/07/11/whats-your-viral-loop-understanding-the-engine-of-adoption/">What&rsquo;s your viral loop?</a>&rdquo;. If you&rsquo;ve ever uttered the phrase &ldquo;viral marketing&rdquo; in connection with your series, you need to read this - it&rsquo;ll change the way you think forever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2007/12/20/is-your-website-a-leaky-bucket-4-scenarios-for-user-retention/">Is Your Website a leaky bucket?</a>&rdquo; is a really great piece for webseries people. Whilst he&rsquo;s talking about analytics as applied to webapp development, all the stuff he&rsquo;s talking about - user retention, how to understand if you&rsquo;re losing people - is just as relevant for a web series. Analytics are powerful and vital - learn how to use them now.</p>

<p>FInally, if you&rsquo;re planning to monetise through advertising, &ldquo;<a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/2008/04/07/5-factors-that-determine-your-advertising-cpm-rates/">5 factors that determine your advertising CPM rates</a>&rdquo; is a very, very useful read if you&rsquo;d like to make more money as opposed to, say, less.</p>

<p>Andrew&rsquo;s list of essays is here: <a href="http://andrewchenblog.com/list-of-essays/">http://andrewchenblog.com/list-of-essays/</a> . I&rsquo;d suggest browsing by category - the titles might sound a bit confusing but there&rsquo;s a hell of a lot of good stuff in there.</p>

<h2 id="peter-bregman">Peter Bregman</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only discovered Peter Bregman recently - he&rsquo;s a serious MBA/big-business type, writing in the Harvard Business Review. Nonetheless, he&rsquo;s got some really great stuff for anyone in any multi-person project, including a web series, mostly focussing on productivity and people management.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<a href="https://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2011/01/the-best-way-to-use-the-last-f.html">The Best Way To Use The Last 5 Minutes Of Your Day</a>&rdquo; was the post that got me reading him. It&rsquo;s a damn simple suggestion, a superb idea, and one I&rsquo;ve implemented (when I remember, I must admit) myself. However, the blog post of his that really got me cheering was &ldquo;<a href="https://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2010/10/why-the-best-solutions-are-alw.html">Why The Best Solutions Are Always Temporary</a>&rdquo; - just read it, particularly if you&rsquo;re ever afflicted with indecision or &ldquo;must think about this more&rdquo;-itis.</p>

<p>Lastly, &ldquo;<a href="https://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2010/09/a-practical-plan-for-when-you-1.html">A Practical Plan For When You&rsquo;re Overwhelmed</a>&rdquo; does, as we say in the UK, exactly what it says on the tin. It&rsquo;s not the only way of coping, but it&rsquo;s a bloody good way.</p>

<p>You can find all Peter&rsquo;s writing at <a href="https://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/">http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/</a></p>

  <p>When you&rsquo;re guerilla showrunning, you&rsquo;re always short of time. There&rsquo;s always more you want to do in less. You&rsquo;re playing catch-up to industries with millions of dollars that themselves are always hurrying. You&rsquo;re trying to make a show with you and a friend in your garage on a weekend, when the guys making &ldquo;24&rdquo;, with millions of dollars and top-name stars, spend as much time panicking about how much time they&rsquo;ve got as you do.</p>

<p>The last things you need are goddamn time vampires.</p>

<p>Time Vampires? Yeah. Those little invisible buggers that soak up hours and hours you don&rsquo;t notice. They aren&rsquo;t the big important tasks that take ages (like editing your episode, for example), they&rsquo;re the little things that just sit there eating time and leave you pissed off and frustrated to boot.</p>

<p>Some of the biggest improvements I&rsquo;ve made to my show creation over the years have all been about staking time vampires to the nearest solid object. Because if you&rsquo;ve got an invisible annoyance sucking hours out of your project, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how <sup>80</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> you are getting about the rest of the gig, it&rsquo;s still going a lot slower than it could.</p>

<p>You need to stake the damn vampires, now. Or, to put it another way, fix the sodding dripping tap, already.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="dripping-taps-can-irritate-your-project-to-death">Dripping Taps Can Irritate Your Project To Death</h2>

<p>On BloodSpell, we had a persistant problem throughout shooting - if we ever let the game cursor, which we couldn&rsquo;t make disappear, hover over a character, they would glow blue. As you can imagine, that was a pain in the ass when shooting, particularly when shooting closeups where a character was occupying more than half the screen. We had to work around it, adapt shots, alter our coverage, and so on.</p>

<p>When we were shooting the final episode of the series, I was having a dig around in the spec for character setup for some reason, and I noticed a &ldquo;glow&rdquo; flag. We were on a break, so I went into our character definitions, and changed the flag from 1 to 0. Loaded the graphics engine up, and&hellip;</p>

<p>No glow.</p>

<p>And what was really interesting here was how much of a huge damn relief it was. We&rsquo;d pretty much written it off as an annoyance we had to live with, right through filming. But as soon as it went away, all sorts of things suddenly became possible. Filming noticably speeded up because we didn&rsquo;t have the - previously unnoticed - step of &ldquo;check if the cursor&rsquo;s making anything glow&rdquo;. Our shot setup was freer. And quality of shooting went right through the roof. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an exaggeration to say that maybe a quarter of the improvement between the series version and the feature version of BloodSpell (which was huge) was down to fixing that damn cursor.</p>

<p>The useful takeaway here isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fix little niggles&rdquo;. I think we all try to fix things that come up - I know we had a good five or ten minute look around for the blue glow when we first found it, didn&rsquo;t find anything we could use, and gave up.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s interesting here is that most people <strong>massively</strong> underestimate how much of a time sink niggles like this are. If something&rsquo;s causing you to bugger around for 3 minutes every time you take a shot, or meaning you have to abandon 5% of your shots, in the middle of shooting you&rsquo;ll tend to go &ldquo;bah, small problem, ignore&rdquo; if you can&rsquo;t easily fix it.</p>

<p>But over the duration of a six-month or year project, that little niggle&rsquo;s going to eat time like it&rsquo;s coated in premium Criolla chocolate.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not just the direct time it takes - it&rsquo;s also the hassle factor.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-t-be-zen-about-a-dripping-tap">You Can&rsquo;t Be Zen About A Dripping Tap</h2>

<p>In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance (which I would heartily recommend to any Guerilla Showrunner - the entire damn thing&rsquo;s about what Quality is and how we achieve it), at one point the narrator visits some friends, who have a dripping tap.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve tried to fix it, but it didn&rsquo;t work, so now they&rsquo;re just ignoring it. And so it goes until Sylvia, one of the friends, suddenly blows up with anger at something unrelated - and the narrator realises that it&rsquo;s actually anger at the damn dripping tap, which she&rsquo;s working so hard to suppress, that&rsquo;s causing it.</p>

<blockquote>What struck me hard then was that she was not blaming the faucet, and that she was deliberately not blaming the faucet. She wasn't ignoring that faucet at all! She was suppressing anger at the faucet and that godamned-dripping faucet was just about killing her!</blockquote>

<p>This really resonates for me.</p>

<p>See, that&rsquo;s exactly how I realised I&rsquo;d been feeling about the blue glow in BloodSpell.</p>

<p>That damn blue glow hadn&rsquo;t just been an irritation. It had been an absolute fucking NIGHTMARE!</p>

<p>It broke my flow. It ruined my shots. It irritated the hell out of me, but I was ignoring it, because fixing it looked Hard.</p>

<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t until I fixed it that I realised what a huge relief that was.</p>

<h2 id="use-of-excessive-force-in-the-case-of-dripping-taps-is-approved">Use Of Excessive Force In The Case of Dripping Taps Is Approved</h2>

<p>So here&rsquo;s my recommendation: if something&rsquo;s pissing you off in your current project, and it&rsquo;s pissing you off enough that you notice it, even if it&rsquo;s a niggle, move heaven and earth to fix it.</p>

<p>Devote serious time to fixing it - a few hours at least, if not a couple of days.</p>

<p>Ask questions on forums. If it&rsquo;s a software problem, contact the developers.</p>

<p>Think around the problem - see if there&rsquo;s a way to completely avoid it. If spending some money would help, consider doing that. (I&rsquo;ve got a post coming on how not spending cash is one of the biggest mistakes you can make on a tiny Web show).</p>

<p>I had another example of this quite recently. The hard disk I was using to edit Death Knight Love Story on just wasn&rsquo;t coping well with the process. It wouldn&rsquo;t play back more than 10 seconds of real-time footage without rendering first. Now, you can work under those circumstances, but it&rsquo;s annoying, and it means you can&rsquo;t be bothered to do quite a lot of fine-tuning if it needs more than 10 seconds of continuous preview to do.</p>

<p>I lived with this for a while, because I couldn&rsquo;t think of any easy alternatives. The best alternative I could think of would involve completely reorganising the office network and putting together a gigabit RAID server from an old machine. And that sounded like a lot of work.</p>

<p>Until, one day, I sat up, and wondered what the hell I was doing. The pausing was pissing me off, it was slowing me down, and it was making my film worse. I called a friend who works in networking, dragged the old machine out of the cupboard, and got going.</p>

<p>The thing that my subconcious had been saying &ldquo;oh, shit, that looks like really hard&rdquo; took about two days total. Not tiny, but well worth it.</p>

<p>And my editing&rsquo;s improved dramatically on the project since. My fight scenes flow better, the entire thing&rsquo;s more fluid, and I don&rsquo;t have embarassing &ldquo;oh, god, that looks awful&rdquo; moments after I&rsquo;ve rendered the final product. Two days to massively improve the edit on a two-year project.</p>

<p>Humans have two well-known cognitive biases: we underestimate the effects of ongoing hassles or frustrations, and we overestimate the likely cost of fixing those hassles, particularly if the fix is partially unknown.</p>

<p>And that means we spend a lot of time wasting time on niggling problems that we could easily solve.</p>

<p>So that&rsquo;s my challenge to you today: sort out the time vampire that&rsquo;s currently battened onto your project.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sort your directory structure out.</li>
<li>Really put some time into fixing that niggling rendering bug.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

<p>Call Alienware about a new laptop.<br />
  * Whatever else has been bugging you.
Get your time back, and then spend it making a great project.</p>

<p>And if you do kill a vampire - or have one that just won&rsquo;t die - tell us about it in the comments!</p>

  <p>Gantt charts.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve heard of them, right?</p>

<p>Enormous great wall-planner things, listing every single thing that you&rsquo;ve got to do on your Masterwork Project, all with neat time schedules, and lists of what depends on what, and colour coding that Means Important Stuff, and&hellip;</p>

<p>Aii. My head hurts just thinking about it.</p>

<p>Do you spend a lot of time feeling guilty about not having a Big Master Plan for your series?</p>

<p>Not having Everything You Need To Do carefully mapped out and controlled? Did you try having one, but felt like you spent all your time updating it?</p>

<p></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time fiddling around with everything from Agile Development to Big-Ass Gantt Charts for planning and managing my guerilla shows.</p>

<p>The conclusion I came to at the end of the day?</p>

<p>You just don&rsquo;t need to know everything you think you need to know.</p>

<p>(But you do need to know some other things.)</p>

<h2 id="how-to-project-plan-in-10-minutes-with-time-for-coffee">How to project plan in 10 minutes with time for coffee</h2>

<p>When I&rsquo;m planning, I&rsquo;ve generally got about 3 things on my to-do list. Not 65, not 247, not 6 on my @RightTheFuckNow list, with another 25 on my @ComputerIfI&rsquo;mNotSurfingPorn list and 435 on my @TheWholeRestOfTheWorldAarghDaylight list.</p>

<p>(Yeah, I tried Getting Things Done. It works, but man, you spend a lot of time on the Getting and not so much on the Doing).</p>

<p>So how does that work? Well, I look at the current series project, and figure out the thing that I need to do next that will most help the project and will take about 2-3 hours. If I&rsquo;m planning tasks larger than that, I&rsquo;m thinking too large.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t write &ldquo;Edit entire episode&rdquo;, unless your episode&rsquo;s 2 minutes long. If it&rsquo;s 15 minutes, write &ldquo;Edit Scene 1&rdquo; instead.</p>

<p>Then I figure out the thing after that. Stick them both on your to-do list.</p>

<p>The trick here, of course, is to figure out what the thing that will <strong>most</strong> help your project is. Normally I&rsquo;ll think about 5 or 10 potential things I could do next (Choose music? Re-edit? Colour grade? Call musicians? Take some lightbox shots?), then stop for a sec.</p>

<p>I have a drink of coffee, and ask if there&rsquo;s any way I can avoid doing each of them, and what will happen if I do.</p>

<p>Choose music? Any way I can get someone else to do that? Or just get a musician in? Colour grade? What&rsquo;ll the episode look like if I don&rsquo;t?</p>

<p>Once I&rsquo;ve done that, I just pick the thing that I need to do that will, in my opinion, advance the project the most. Don&rsquo;t sweat this too much - you either know or you don&rsquo;t. If you don&rsquo;t, choose, get it wrong, learn.</p>

<p>Stick it on the to-do list.</p>

<p>Now do the same with the thing after that.</p>

<p>OK, you&rsquo;re done. That&rsquo;s your to-do list. Go do it. When you&rsquo;ve done it, make another one.</p>

<p>(You might notice there&rsquo;s only two items on that list, wheras I said I&rsquo;d generally have 3. That&rsquo;s because I tend to split series up into two sides - marketing and production - and have a to-do list running for both, with one or two items on each.)</p>

<h2 id="the-psychology-of-the-whole-thing">The Psychology Of The Whole Thing</h2>

<p>If your to-do list&rsquo;s longer than you can expect to get done today, from my experience, you&rsquo;re doing it wrong.</p>

<p>The longer your list, the more disheartening it is to see an endless pile of uncompleted tasks. The more time you&rsquo;ll spend sitting there choosing what to work on. The more time you&rsquo;ll spend working on stuff that&rsquo;s easy rather than stuff that&rsquo;s important.</p>

<p>If &ldquo;Call famous actor&rdquo; is item #15 of 47, well, let&rsquo;s be honest. You&rsquo;ll avoid doing that scary task for <strong>months</strong>.</p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s Item #2 and you&rsquo;ve already done #1 - you&rsquo;ve got no other choices. You&rsquo;re doing it. And then you&rsquo;ll feel great afterward.</p>

<p>In addition, humans tend to think we&rsquo;re much better at predicting outcomes than we actually are. Looooooong to-do lists are predicated on the belief that we can predict what our series is going to need two, three, four, twelve weeks in advance. But the fact is that the situation&rsquo;s constantly changing.</p>

<p>What you&rsquo;re going to need for your next episode might totally change next week when you realise that&rsquo;s the episode that&rsquo;s going to get a front-of-YouTube feature if you can get it to them a week earlier than you&rsquo;d planned.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s how the psychology works. Great, innit?</p>

<h2 id="but-how-don-t-you-drop-stuff">But How Don&rsquo;t You Drop Stuff?</h2>

<p>But surely you&rsquo;ll end up skipping vital things, forgetting to call people back, missing key tasks?</p>

<p>Not really. For starters, unlike something like computer programming, making an audio-visual program&rsquo;s a pretty linear task. There aren&rsquo;t huge numbers of dependencies that will bite you in the ass if you&rsquo;re not constantly chasing them.</p>

<p>But of course there are a few.</p>

<p>So, for starters, I keep a second list alongside my main one, which is a complete list of everything that I&rsquo;m expecting from other people, or they&rsquo;re expecting from me. Direction for my animator, a review for the guy doing a re-edit for me, a reply from the big blogger I&rsquo;m pestering for a feature.</p>

<p>Keep that updated every time anything changes - every time you promise someone something or they promise you something - and refer to it when you&rsquo;re putting your to-do list together.</p>

<p>Second, every month or so it&rsquo;s worth doing a slightly more complete look at your project. Start from your end goal (which I&rsquo;ll talk about in another post - suffice it to say that your end goal is almost never &ldquo;Finish the episode&rdquo;, but is more like &ldquo;Get 150 positive comments on the episode&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Now, work backward and think about the major blocks of work you&rsquo;ll have to do - promotion, uploading, editing, grading, shooting, and so on. For each of them, think about what elements you&rsquo;ll need to have in place in advance, and what delays you could hit. Don&rsquo;t worry about the fine detail, though - just visualise doing it, and then think about stuff that will take time.</p>

<p>For example, when you&rsquo;re promoting you need to think about lead times for magazines and TV programs (months, often), which means you&rsquo;ll need to be contacting them well in advance (and will also need your film finished way before you release it, but that&rsquo;s also a topic for another time).</p>

<p>Go through the lot, and make a list of stuff that needs to get done well in advance for each segment, and roughly how much in advance it&rsquo;ll need to get done.</p>

<p>Keep that with your &ldquo;people who owe me stuff&rdquo; list and, again, refer to it when you put your to-do list together.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not very precise, and you&rsquo;ll drop stuff!</p>

<p>True.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll do that if you have a Master To-Do List too.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to forget something important in a 100-item list.</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;ll also over-plan - you&rsquo;ll do what I did only last year, for example, and attempt to organise recruitment for actors when, as it turns out, you won&rsquo;t need them for another year because you need to go through another two animatic drafts.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re going to drop stuff and screw up either way. You&rsquo;re going to end up with delays, confusion, missed stuff - that&rsquo;s the joy of being a producer.</p>

<p>But if you keep everything simple, at least you won&rsquo;t have to update all 1,527 items on your To-Do List every time it happens.</p>
